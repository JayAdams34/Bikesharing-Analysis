## Summary of Bikesharing
  Based on the information provided I would say even though Des Moines is far less populated, I believe a bikesharing program would be appropriate. Two additional visualizations that could be added is a graph based on the age of the customer to see what would be your target market, and we could also do a visualization based on the name of each stations to see which specific stations has the higher volume.
